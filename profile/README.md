## MADSci Node Modules

An incomplete list of integrated devices available for use in your automated and autonomous laboratories:

- [ot2_module](https://github.com/AD-SDL/ot2_module): integration of the Opentrons OT-2 and Flex
- [pf400_module](https://github.com/AD-SDL/pf400_module): integration of the Precise Automation PF400 robotic sample handling arm
- [sciclops_module](https://github.com/AD-SDL/sciclops_module): integration of the Hudson Robotics Sciclops robotic plate crane
- [barty_module](https://github.com/AD-SDL/barty_module): integration for Barty the Bartending Robot, RPL's own liquid dispensing robot.
- [camera_module](https://github.com/AD-SDL/camera_module): integration for taking pictures with USB webcams

More to come as we migrate module's from MADSci's predecessor, WEI! If you've got a MADSci Node Module you've developed that you want to see included in this list, let us know!

## MADSci-powered Labs

An incomplete list of automated and autonomous labs using MADSci:

- [rpl_sdl](https://github.com/AD-SDL/rpl_sdl): The Rapid Prototyping Lab @ Argonne National Laboratory, a test bed for autonomous discovery and self-driving laboratory research and engineering

More to come as we migrate our existing SDL's from MADSci's predecessor, WEI! If you've got a MADSci-powered lab that you want to see included in this list, let us know!

## MADSci-powered Experiments

An incomplete list of experiments using MADSci:

- [colorpicker_experiment](https://github.com/AD-SDL/colorpicker_experiment): basic demonstration and benchmarking experiment for self-driving labs using MADSci

More to come as we migrate our existing experiments from MADSci's predecessor, WEI! If you've got a MADSci-powered experiment that you want to see included in this list, let us know!

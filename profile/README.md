More to come as we migrate module's from MADSci's predecessor, WEI! If you've got a MADSci Node Module you've developed that you want to see included in this list, let us know!

## MADSci-powered Labs

An incomplete list of automated and autonomous labs using MADSci:

- [rpl_sdl](https://github.com/AD-SDL/rpl_sdl): The Rapid Prototyping Lab @ Argonne National Laboratory, a test bed for autonomous discovery and self-driving laboratory research and engineering
- [aarl200_sdl](https://github.com/AD-SDL/aarl200_sdl): The Argonne Autonomous Research Laboratory 200 (AARL-200), an autonomous Chemistry laboratory in ANL's Building 200.

More to come as we migrate our existing SDL's from MADSci's predecessor, WEI! If you've got a MADSci-powered lab that you want to see included in this list, let us know!

## MADSci-powered Experiments

An incomplete list of experiments using MADSci:

- [colorpicker_experiment](https://github.com/AD-SDL/colorpicker_experiment): basic demonstration and benchmarking experiment for self-driving labs using MADSci

More to come as we migrate our existing experiments from MADSci's predecessor, WEI! If you've got a MADSci-powered experiment that you want to see included in this list, let us know!
